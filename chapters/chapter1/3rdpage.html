<p>JavaScript supports the following types of operators:</p>
<p>•Arithmetic Operators</p>
<p>•Comparison Operators</p>
<p>•Logical (or Relational) Operators</p>
<p>•Assignment Operators</p>
<p>•Conditional (or ternary) Operators</p>
<p><b>Arithmetic Operators</b></p>
<p><b>+ (Addition)</b></p>
<p>Adds two operands</p>
<p>Ex: A + B will give 30</p>
<p><b>- (Subtraction)</b></p>
<p>Subtracts the second operand from the first</p>
<p>Ex: A - B will give -10</p>
<p><b>* (Multiplication)</b></p>
<p> Multiply both operands.</p>
<p>Ex: A * B will give 200</p>
<p><b>/ (Division)</b></p>
<p>Divide the numerator by the denominator</p>
<p>Ex: B / A will give 2</p>
<p><b>% (Modulus)</b></p>
<p>Outputs the remainder of an integer division</p>
<p>Ex: B % A will give 0</p>
<p><b>++ (Increment)</b></p>
<p>Increases an integer value by one</p>
<p>Ex: A++ will give 11</p>
<p><b> -- (Decrement)</b></p>
<p>Decreases an integer value by one</p>
<p>Ex: A-- will give 9</p>

<p><b>Comparison Operators</b></p>
<p><b>== (Equal)</b></p>
<p>Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Ex: (A == B) is not true.</p>
<p><b>!= (Not Equal)</b></p>
<p>Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Ex: (A != B) is true</p>
<p><b>> (Greater than)</b></p>
<p>Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Ex: (A > B) is not true.</p>
<p><b>< (Less than)</b></p>
<p>Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Ex: (A < B) is true.</p>
<p><b>>= (Greater than or Equal to)</b></p>
<p>Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Ex: (A >= B) is not true.</p>
<p><b> <= (Less than or Equal to)</b></p>
<p>Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Ex: (A <= B) is true.</p>

<p><b>Logical Operators</b></p>
<p><b>&& (Logical AND)</b></p>
<p>If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Ex: (A && B) is true.</p>
<p><b> || (Logical OR)</b></p>
<p>If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Ex: (A || B) is true.</p>
<p><b>! (Logical NOT)</b></p>
<p>Reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then the logical NOT operator will make it false.</p>
<p>Ex: ! (A && B) is false.</p>


<p><b>Bitwise Operators</b></p>
<p><b>& (Bitwise AND)</b></p>
<p>It performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments.</p>
<p>Ex: (A & B) is 2.</p>
<p><b> | (BitWise OR)</b></p>
<p>It performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments.</p>
<p>Ex: (A | B) is 3.</p>
<p><b> 	^ (Bitwise XOR)</b></p>
</p>It performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. Exclusive OR means that either operand one is true or operand two is true, but not both.</p>
<p>Ex: (A ^ B) is 1.</p>
<p><b> << (Left Shift)</b></p>
<p>It moves all the bits in its first operand to the left by the number of places specified in the second operand. New bits are filled with zeros. Shifting a value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying it by 2, shifting two positions is equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on.</p>
<p>Ex: (A << 1) is 4.</p>
<p><b>>> (Right Shift)</b></p>
<p>Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operand’s value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.</p>
<p>Ex: (A >> 1) is 1.</p>
<p><b> >>> (Right shift with Zero)</b></p>
<p>This operator is just like the >> operator, except that the bits shifted in on the left are always zero.</p>
<p>Ex: (A >>> 1) is 1.</p>

<p><b>Assignment Operators</b></p>
<p><b>= (Simple Assignment )</b></p>
<p>Assigns values from the right side operand to the left side operand.</p>
<p>Ex: C = A + B will assign the value of A + B into C</p>
<p><b>+= (Add and Assignment)</b></p>
<p>It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.</p>
<p>Ex: C += A is equivalent to C = C + A</p>
<p><b>-= (Subtract and Assignment)</b></p>
<p>It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.</p>
<p>Ex: C -= A is equivalent to C = C – A</p>
<p><b>*= (Multiply and Assignment)</b></p>
<p>It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.</p>
<p>Ex: C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A</p>
<p><b>/= (Divide and Assignment)</b></p>
<p>It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.</p>
<p>Ex: C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A</p>
<p><b>%= (Modules and Assignment)</b></p>
<p>It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.</p>
<p>Ex: C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A</p>

<p><b>typeof</b></p>
<p> The typeof operator is a unary operator that is placed before its single operand, which can be of any type. Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand.
The typeof operator evaluates to "number", "string", or "boolean" if its operand is a number, string, or boolean value and returns true or false based on the evaluation.
Here is a list of the return values for the typeof Operator.</p>
